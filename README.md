## **Project Description**
As part of the Data & Analytics for the UK National Rail, you are tasked with understanding customer behavior, from purchasing patterns to travel preferences, from the previous winter season to inform the design of personalized offerings & strategies. As part of an effort to stay competitive, the company plans to roll out a new promotional program offering ticket bundles and targeted discounts tailored to travelers' needs for the upcoming Winter season. 

The goal is to drive a **+25%** increase in redemption rate on the programâ€™s offers compared to last yearâ€™s promotions, which targeted a mass audience.
