# Customer-Segmentation-UK-Rail
An Ongoing Project: Understanding Customer Behavior to Guide Data-driven Promotion Offerings


üìä **Quick-read!**

Utilizing the UK National Rail dataset, I strengthened my expertise in customer segmentation and behavioral analysis using Python.

I conducted comprehensive data preprocessing, led exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover customer behavior patterns, and am currently developing K-means clustering models to support the design of personalized ticket bundles and targeted discount strategies.

üìç**Skills:**¬†Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib), Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, K-means Clustering

## **Project Description**
As part of the Data & Analytics for the UK National Rail, you are tasked with understanding customer behavior, from purchasing patterns to travel preferences, from the previous winter season to inform the design of personalized offerings & strategies. As part of an effort to stay competitive, the company plans to roll out a new promotional program offering ticket bundles and targeted discounts tailored to travelers' needs for the upcoming Winter season. 

The goal is to drive a **+25%** increase in redemption rate on the program‚Äôs offers compared to last year‚Äôs promotions, which targeted a mass audience. 

**Key Actions**

- **Data Preprocessing:** Performed data type conversions, handled missing and duplicate values, parsed JSON fields, and derived new variables to support analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Analyzed purchase and travel behavior to identify key patterns and trends; conducted deep dives into notable customer behaviors.
- **Model Development (Ongoing):** Applying K-means clustering to refine and validate customer segments, with the goal of further categorizing new customers.

**Key Findings**

**Next Steps**

- Conduct price-sensitivity analysis to fine-tune offers.
- Utilize K-means clustering to validate and expand customer segments.
