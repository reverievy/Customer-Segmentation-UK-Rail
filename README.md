# 🚎 Customer-Segmentation-UK-Rail
Understanding Customer Behavior to Guide Data-driven Promotion Offerings


📊 **Quick-read!**

Utilizing the UK National Rail dataset, I delved into behavioral analysis and customer segmentation using Python, uncovering 7 customer personas and associated characteristics in their purchase and travel patterns. 

These behavioral segments can help inform UK Rail’s:

⭐️ **Personalization strategies:** Price-saving deals, Weekend-getaway bundles, Time-sensitive discounts, and more

⭐️ **Future App features:** One-click ticket purchase, Total Savings portal, Price-alert for frequently traveled routes, and more

As an avid Amtrak user myself, the unraveling of segment behaviors, especially the Student & Last-minute persona, really hit home to me 

📍**Tools:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

📍**Skills:** Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, Behavioral Segmentation




## **Project Description**
As part of the Data & Analytics for the UK National Rail, I'm tasked with understanding customer behavior, from purchasing patterns to travel preferences, from the previous winter season to inform the design of personalized offerings & strategies. As part of an effort to stay competitive, the company plans to roll out a new promotional program offering ticket bundles and targeted discounts tailored to travelers' needs for the upcoming Winter season. 

The goal is to drive a **+25%** increase in redemption rate on the program’s offers compared to last year’s promotions, which targeted a mass audience. 

**🚎 Key Actions**

- **Data Preprocessing:** Performed data type conversions, handled missing and duplicate values, parsed JSON fields, and derived new variables to support analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Analyzed purchase and travel behavior to identify key patterns and trends; conducted deep dives into notable customer behaviors.
- **Model Development (Ongoing):** Applying K-means clustering to refine and validate customer segments, with the goal of further categorizing new customers.
